# Learning with AI – Spell Arena  
**Author:** Landen Tomlin  
**Course:** ASE 485 – Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository documents how I use AI as a learning and development aid for my capstone project, **Spell Arena**. Spell Arena is a real-time multiplayer wizard combat game built in Unity that uses gesture-based inputs to cast spells.

My individual contributions to the project focus on **player experience (UX)**, **accessibility**, **visual design**, and **replayability systems**. AI is used as a support tool to help research design patterns, evaluate usability decisions, prototype gameplay systems, and reflect on player-facing features before and during implementation.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate intentional, structured use of AI to support learning and development—not to replace independent problem solving.

## Topic 1: Visual Theming and Art Direction for Gameplay Clarity

### Why I Need to Learn This

Spell Arena is a fast-paced multiplayer game where players must quickly interpret spell effects, UI elements, and opponent actions. Without a cohesive visual theme and clear art direction, players may become overwhelmed or confused during gameplay.

A strong visual theme is essential for:
- Improving readability during combat
- Supporting accessibility
- Creating a consistent and immersive player experience

---

### What I Want to Learn

- **Game UI Color Theory:** Selecting palettes that remain readable during motion and visual effects
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Emphasizing critical information such as health, cooldowns, and active spells
- **Theming Consistency:** Applying a unified art direction across menus, HUD, and effects
- **Accessibility Considerations:** Contrast, colorblind-safe design, and visual clarity

---

### How I Learn with AI

- Ask AI to propose visual themes suitable for a fantasy combat game
- Use AI to critique planned UI layouts from a UX and accessibility perspective
- Compare multiple art direction approaches and evaluate trade-offs
- Validate contrast and readability decisions before implementation

AI serves as a design review and ideation partner rather than a source of final assets.

## Topic 2: Replayability and Reward System Design

### Why I Need to Learn This

Multiplayer games rely heavily on replayability. Without meaningful progression or rewards, players may lose interest after a small number of matches. My goal is to design a reward system that encourages continued play without affecting competitive balance.

---

### What I Want to Learn

- **Player Motivation:** Understanding intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
- **Cosmetic Reward Systems:** Rewards that do not alter gameplay fairness
- **Feedback Loops:** Communicating rewards clearly after matches
- **Expandable Design:** Building systems that can grow without major refactoring

---

### How I Learn with AI

- Research reward and progression systems used in competitive multiplayer games
- Brainstorm reward ideas and evaluate feasibility and scope
- Use AI to critique reward presentation and pacing
- Identify potential balance or UX issues before implementation

AI is used to validate design ideas and highlight risks early in development.

## Topic 3: Assistive Features and Accessibility for New Players

### Why I Need to Learn This

Gesture-based gameplay can create a high learning curve for new players. Without proper onboarding and assistive tools, players may become frustrated and disengage early.

The goal is to support learning while preserving skill expression.

---

### What I Want to Learn

- **Onboarding Design:** Gradual introduction of mechanics
- **In-Game Assistance:** Tooltips, pinned movesets, and contextual help
- **Post-Match Feedback:** Helping players learn from mistakes
- **Optional Accessibility:** Allowing assistive features to be toggled

---

### How I Learn with AI

- Study assistive UX patterns from competitive and accessibility-focused games
- Evaluate proposed assistive features for clarity and usefulness
- Use AI to analyze player psychology related to feedback and learning
- Reflect on whether implemented features meet accessibility goals

AI is used to refine usability decisions and reduce trial-and-error.
