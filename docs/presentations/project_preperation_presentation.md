# Learning with AI  
## Spell Arena – Capstone Reflection

**Landen Tomlin**  
ASE 485 – Capstone Project

---

# Project Context

## Spell Arena

- Real-time multiplayer wizard combat game  
- Gesture-based spell casting  
- Built in **Unity**  

**My Focus Areas**
- Player experience (UX)
- Accessibility
- Visual design
- Replayability systems

---

# Why Use AI?

AI is used as a **learning and design support tool**, not a replacement for development.

It helps me:
- Research design patterns  
- Evaluate usability decisions  
- Prototype gameplay systems  
- Reflect on player-facing features  

---

# Learning Topic 1

## Visual Theming & Art Direction

### Why This Matters
- Fast-paced combat requires clarity
- Poor visuals increase confusion
- Accessibility depends on contrast and hierarchy

---

## What I Learn with AI

- UI color theory for games  
- Visual hierarchy for HUD elements  
- Consistent theming across menus and gameplay  
- Accessibility-focused design choices  

---

## How AI Helps

- Proposing visual themes
- Critiquing UI layouts
- Comparing art direction approaches
- Validating contrast and readability

---

# Learning Topic 2

## Replayability & Reward Systems

### Why This Matters
- Multiplayer games rely on retention
- Rewards encourage continued play
- Balance must be preserved

---

## What I Learn with AI

- Player motivation (intrinsic vs extrinsic)
- Cosmetic reward design
- Post-match feedback loops
- Expandable progression systems

---

## How AI Helps

- Researching proven reward systems
- Brainstorming reward ideas
- Identifying balance or UX issues
- Refining reward presentation

---

# Learning Topic 3

## Assistive Features & Accessibility

### Why This Matters
- Gesture controls have a learning curve
- New players need support
- Assistance should not remove skill expression

---

## What I Learn with AI

- Onboarding design strategies
- In-game assistive UX patterns
- Post-match feedback design
- Optional accessibility systems

---

## How AI Helps

- Evaluating assistive feature ideas
- Analyzing player learning psychology
- Refining clarity and usability
- Reducing trial-and-error

---

# Learning Goals

## Success Metrics

- UI is readable and consistent  
- Rewards encourage replay without imbalance  
- New players complete matches with less confusion  

---

# Summary

- AI supports **learning, design, and reflection**
- Decisions remain developer-driven
- AI improves iteration speed and design quality
- Focus is on better player experience
